■ Regarding Bonus Content Added in Version 1.05
  
  The following four requirements must be met
  to enter the "forbidden house" on Resort Island.

1. Know the password from True Ending 1.
2. Have 40 or more Guilt.
3. Come on Day 7 during the day.
4. Clear the dungeon you can access with a certain four compasses
   (accessed from the roof of the Guide-Selling Old Lady's house).


  It's geared toward devoted players, so the requirements are fairly strict.
  If you have time, I hope you'll enjoy it.
