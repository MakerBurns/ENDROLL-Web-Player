■ Game Hints

There are three endings.
One is the Normal Ending, and the other two are True Endings.
(The two true endings have variations for different characters.)

※ Also, the password displayed in True End 1 is required
  for obtaining clear bonuses and accessing the bonus content.
  You obtain the rewards from the mailbox in the gallery house.
  There are many useful items for repeat playthroughs.

Details on how to get the endings are below.
Very spoilery, so beware.

■ Requirements to see the Normal Ending

If you have less than 20 Guilt at the end of Day 5,
you automatically go to the Normal Ending.
(The night of Day 5 offers enough opportunities to recover.)

■ Requirements to see True Ending 1 or 2

Have 20 or more Guilt by the end of Day 5.
On the night of Day 7, you'll be given a choice.
Choose "What should I do?" → True Ending 1
Choose "No..." → True Ending 2

Additionally, the character you choose as your patrol partner on Day 6
ends up as a cruicial character in both True Endings.

■ Guilt-Rasing Events

The ending branches are largely dependent on a variable called Guilt.
Below are the events which increase your Guilt, so if you're aiming for endings,
check this frequently. (More detail is given on the site.)

[ Day 1 ]
  No Guilt-raising events.
[ Day 2 ]
  No Guilt-raising events.

[ Day 3 ]

………………………………………………………………………………………

If you complete all the above events, you end up with 60 Guilt.
Since the Guilt-based branch is on Day 5, there honestly isn't much point to Day 6 and 7's events.
But it might be fun to go whole-hog and aim for a perfect score of 60.

Also, you can check your Guilt in-game by talking to the Nightmares in various places.
However, not the Nightmares who chase after Russell.
If you enter battle with them, you definitely can't win.
