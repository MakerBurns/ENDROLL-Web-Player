■ Summary
  The story of a boy moving into "Nameless Town,"
  helping out the townspeople, and living a relaxed life.

■ Comments
・ This game contains horrific and grotesque elements,
  and depictions of many immoral acts. (Recommended age: 15 or older.)

・ It's an RPG with battles, but also lots of exploration.
  You can generally save anytime, and it's not too difficult.
  You shouldn't need to grind levels much.

・ The graphics and BGM are almost all original.
  I worked hard on them, so please praise me. (Very direct...)

・ There's about a 4 to 6 ratio of main plot to diversions.
  It might be best suited for leisurely play sessions.

■ About Let's Plays and Streams

[ Let's Plays ]
  I feel like it's not very suited for LPing, but if you want to...
  However, since the game is recommended for ages 15 and up, you must make that clear.
  You're also free to LP the bonus content added in version 1.05.
  
  Please include the game's name in the video title, and link to the END ROLL site:
  http://nantekotodesyoune.wix.com/endroll/ (Japanese)
  http://vgperson.com/games/endroll.htm (English Translation)
  Please refrain from slander. Have some manners.

[ Live Streams ]
  I have received reports of someone with bad manners on a stream,
  but I wasn't watching it myself, so I can't judge that for myself.
  People's opinions can vary, and I want to trust in people's good will,
  so I won't be taking any measures for now.
  However, I'm truly sorry for the trouble. Thank you.

  However, if people continue to have bad manners,
  I may ban playthroughs or streams, or at worst, take the game down.
  To repeat, when doing a playthrough:
  "Please refrain from slander. Have some manners."
